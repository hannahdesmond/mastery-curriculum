# Mastery Curriculum

Welcome to the Makers Academy Ruby mastery curriculum! Your aim will be to become confident writing real-world procedural programs in Ruby.

* **Real-world?** Programs that are useful in the real world. For example, a program to manage your todo list.
* **Procedural?** Programs that do something by working through a series of steps. Somewhat like cooking recipes.

## Approach

1. Work through a chapter \(see below\).

2. When you feel confident with the **Learning Objectives** at the top of each chapter, complete the quiz for the chapter.  You can do that at the [quiz repository](https://github.com/makersacademy/mastery-quizzes).

3. Once you have submitted your quiz answers, and your answers have been verified as correct, continue to the next chapter.

> The chapters here aren't the only way to become confident with the Learning Objectives. Research them using Google, play with the code in the code examples or on your own computer, or diagram the sorts of processes being described. Get interactive with the material, and pick your own learning route!

Your aim is to get through all the chapters, but the most important thing for your learning is to only move on from a chapter once you've completed the quiz.

**Note: the mastery learning quizzes can take a long time to complete. Also, the later quizzes tend to take more time than the earlier quizzes. It's really important to get started on Monday of Week 2 of the PreCourse and put in lots of time over the next 2 weeks.**
